### Development process
#####
* _The development process_: 

* _Architecture_: 
* * The development architecture have I been using `ER-Diagram` for create the tables and work out the __(PK)__ and __(FK)__, and for my own knowledge future on the road, keep things simple and don't do it complex.

* _My SQL Workbench_:
* * I have been using `(My-SQL-Workbench)` in order to create the connection to the database in `(DB-gate)` and implement the table and query for each table.
The configuration and setup have been worked out through the `(My-SQL-Workbench)` eviorment to make sure the `(CRUD)` query's is working for each table.
* _JDBC_:
* * My next step was to set up the java program and implement the tables from the `(ER-diagrams)` and `(My-SQL-Workbench)` environment. To create the right classes and make sure the crud queries where working through java with the database.
